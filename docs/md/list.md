To analyze Reynolds stress, turbulent heat flux, and velocity and temperature distributions in the context of film cooling, one should follow a detailed methodology encompassing both theoretical and computational approaches. Here's an explanation based on the provided document:

### Reynolds Stress Analysis

1. **Definition and Importance**:
   - Reynolds stress components (\(\overline{u'u'}\), \(\overline{v'v'}\), \(\overline{w'w'}\), and \(\overline{u'v'}\)) represent the turbulent fluctuations in the flow field, providing insight into the energy distribution and turbulence intensity in the fluid.
   - Understanding Reynolds stresses helps in identifying the turbulence structure and its impact on heat and momentum transfer.

2. **Measurement and Calculation**:
   - Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is employed to capture the detailed turbulence structures and their evolution in the flow.
   - The Reynolds stress components are normalized by the freestream velocity squared to facilitate comparison across different regions and conditions.

3. **Spatial Distribution**:
   - The study analyzes Reynolds stresses at various locations downstream of the film cooling holes (e.g., \(x/D = 2, 5, 10, 15\)).
   - It observes that the peak normal stresses move further away from the wall with increasing blowing ratios, indicating the jet's lift-off from the surface.

4. **Comparison Between Hole Types**:
   - Fan-shaped and cylindrical holes show different Reynolds stress distributions, with fan-shaped holes generally displaying higher turbulence intensities at lower blowing ratios compared to cylindrical holes.

### Turbulent Heat Flux Analysis

1. **Definition and Importance**:
   - Turbulent heat flux components (\(\overline{v't'}\)) quantify the rate of heat transfer due to turbulent motions, critical for understanding the cooling effectiveness.
   - These fluxes indicate how well the coolant mixes with the mainstream flow, influencing the overall temperature distribution.

2. **Measurement and Calculation**:
   - Turbulent heat flux is defined as the Favre-averaged product of velocity fluctuation and non-dimensional temperature fluctuation.
   - The non-dimensional temperature is computed using \( \eta = \frac{T - T_c}{T_m - T_c} \), where \(T\) is the local temperature, \(T_c\) is the coolant temperature, and \(T_m\) is the mainstream temperature.

3. **Spatial Distribution**:
   - The heat flux distribution is analyzed along the wall-normal direction and at various streamwise positions.
   - Typically, a negative peak in the turbulent heat flux indicates the transfer of heat from the freestream to the coolant jet, commonly observed at the jet's upper edge.

4. **Comparison Between Hole Types**:
   - Fan-shaped holes tend to maintain a closer interaction with the wall, leading to more effective cooling near the surface.
   - Cylindrical holes, on the other hand, often show heat flux peaks further from the wall, especially at higher blowing ratios, indicating a less effective cooling mechanism.

### Velocity and Temperature Distribution Analysis

1. **Definition and Importance**:
   - The velocity (\(u, v, w\)) and temperature (\(T\)) distributions are crucial for understanding the flow dynamics and thermal behavior of the coolant jet.
   - These distributions help in assessing how the coolant spreads and mixes with the mainstream flow.

2. **Measurement and Calculation**:
   - Favre-averaged velocity and temperature profiles are computed to account for density variations in the turbulent flow.
   - These profiles are normalized to highlight self-similar behavior, facilitating comparison across different blowing ratios and hole geometries.

3. **Spatial Distribution**:
   - Velocity and temperature profiles are analyzed at multiple downstream positions (e.g., \(x/D = 2, 5, 10, 15\)).
   - The study identifies regions where the jet exhibits self-similar behavior, meaning the profiles collapse onto a single curve when appropriately scaled.

4. **Comparison Between Hole Types**:
   - Fan-shaped holes tend to show self-similar velocity and temperature profiles more rapidly downstream compared to cylindrical holes.
   - Cylindrical holes may require higher blowing ratios to achieve similar levels of self-similarity, indicating differences in the jet development and mixing efficiency.

### Summary

- **Reynolds Stress**: Provides detailed turbulence characteristics; important for understanding the energy distribution in the flow.
- **Turbulent Heat Flux**: Indicates the efficiency of heat transfer and mixing; critical for assessing cooling performance.
- **Velocity and Temperature Distributions**: Essential for evaluating the overall flow dynamics and thermal behavior; important for ensuring effective cooling.

By employing LES and detailed post-processing, the study offers comprehensive data that can improve the design and effectiveness of film cooling systems, providing insights into the turbulence structures and heat transfer mechanisms in fan-shaped and cylindrical cooling holes    .
